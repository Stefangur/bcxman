## Export your Translation Project

Just as for the Import, there are two ways you can export your translations: 

- Single file export per language
- Complete project export to a .zip file

Go to the project and open Target Languages, click **Export Translation Files**: 

You will be prompted if you wish to export just the current language file, or all languages in the project: 

![Export](/.assets/export-translations.png)

Exporting all languages will generate a zip file with all .xlf files, a single language just the .xlf file for that language.
