## Translation Projects

Before creating your first normal project, you may want to import one or more **[Reference Projects](#reference-projects)**


### Setting up a Translation Project. 

From the Role Center, click **Translation Projects**, or ALt-Q search for it. And Create a New entry in the project list: 

![Creating a translation project](/.assets/projects-create.png)

- **Project Code** Enter a short unique project code identifier
- **Project Name** Name of Project (Can be overwritten when you import files). This would typically be the same as the project name you use for your Business Central solution. If your generated master translation file gets named myproject.g.xlf then you Project Name will be myproject.
- **Status** Is just for your own housekeeping use to keep track of the state of projects
- **NAV Version** Currently only supports "Microsoft Business Central", if you ned NAV2018 support, take a look at the original translation project that this was based on here : [AL-Translate-Tool-15](https://github.com/peikba/AL-Translate-Tool-15)
- **Source Language** If you set source language in the Setup screen, it will be defaulted here based on that. This will usually be ENU
- **Source Language ISO** Should be set automatically based on source language. If this is empty you may have missed the iso code part of the [Setup](/.assets/Setup.md)

You have two ways to initialize the translation project from your code solution: 

#### Individual imports

To set up the project, start by importing the source file: With you new project selected in the Project list, click **"Import Source"**. Select the .g.xlf file that was generated by your project build. Usually in a /translations folder in your project. 

After the import completes, you can click **Translation Source** and see the imported source texts: 

![Translation source list](/.assets/projects-translationsource.png)

Notice that the notes for each label was also imported, this can give developer hints and information about where the label is used

Next, **Setup Target Languages**, this is also done from the Project List. 

You can setup target translations in the Translation tool without having target files, but if you already made translations you can import the existing translations in the target files. No matter which option you choose you need to create the Target Languages first: 

**Note: An easy way to import and create target languages at once is to import the complete translation project. See [Project Import](#project-import)**

Click **Target Languages" for your project in the list, and add a Target language (Project will be filled in) : 

![Target Languages](/.assets/project-target-language.png)

- **Target Language** Pick language and the Target ISO Code will be filled in automatically
- **Equivalent Language** You can choose that this language translation is an exact copy of another. So if you add target language ESM es-MX, and want to reuse your spanish translations from ESP, es-ES, you can specify ESP as Equivalent language for ESM and the tool will generate identical translations for this language. 

After setting up that Target language, select **Import Target** and pick the myproject.iso.xlf file corresponding to your selected language. In the example about we import transtest.da-DK.xlf.

![Translation Targets](/.assets/project-translation-targets.png)

You can continue to setup all you Target languages like this. If you have many target languages and translations already done, an easier and faster way is to use the Project Import feature.

#### Project Import

To prepare to import a complete translation project for your solution, create a **.zip archive** of all the files in the /translation folder of your BC project. You only need to include the .xlf files, but the import will skip any files that aren't .xlf or .xliff. 

Your source translation file should have the .g.xlf extension. 

Go to te Translation Project List and select the project you want to import, then click **Import Project**

**Note:** Project Import always overwrites all source and target languages for your project, so in general you only do this to create the initial translation project, or if you have made a lot of changes outside the translation tool. 

If you want to leverage translations from other projects or standard BC translations, set up **[Reference Projects](#reference-projects)** before you import your own translation project

**Next : [Work with Translations](/.assets/Translations.md)

## Reference Projects

To improve translation consistency you can setup one or more referene projects. Translations in these projects will be reused if the same terms are used in your own projects. 

One obvious reference project is the base application. If you have access to the source translation files (they are part of the On-Prem images of BC) you can load those in BCXMAN, and when your own terms match one that is already translated in the base app, it will reuse it. This isn't a guaranteed fit since in some cases the same term can have more than one translation in the base, but it's a pretty good start. 

Create a project called **Base Reference**:

![Base Reference](/.assets/project-reference.png)

And add a Danish target language (You don't need to add source language for a reference project):

![Danish Reference Language](/.assets/project-target-language.png)

You then import the Base Ap da-DK xlf file: 

![Danish Language File](/.assets/project-reference-dan-file.png)

The import can take up to 10 minutes. **Note:** If you are unable to upload the large file to your docker image, it can be because the iage has a very low limit for file uploads to the IIS. Then you need to change the maxAllowedContentLength and uploadReadAheadSize to a larger number. 

Now you can regenerate the translations for your project, for our small test translation project, the Danish translations looked like this before:

![Danish Translations without reference](/.assets/translation-with-terms-4o.png)

And now, after using the Base App Translation as reference, the terms are corrected : 

![Danish Translation with reference](/.assets/project-reference-dan-result.png)

So we now got the correct term for Lead Time Calculation in Danish. 

When you are happy with your translation project, the final step is to **[export the xlf files]()
